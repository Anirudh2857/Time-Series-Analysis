This project aims to analyze the Bitcoin price data from 2013 to 2021 using various time series models. The models used in this project are naive model, model_1_dense_w7_h1, model_2_dense_w30_h1, model_3_dense_w30_h7, model_4_CONV1D, model_5_LSTM, model_6_multivariate, model_8_NBEATs, model_9_ensemble, and model_10_turkey. The output received from these models are mae, mse, rmse, mape, and mase.

Models Used

Naive Model
This model uses the previous day's price as the prediction for the next day.

Model_1_dense_w7_h1
This model uses a dense neural network with a window size of 7 and a horizon of 1.

Model_2_dense_w30_h1
This model uses a dense neural network with a window size of 30 and a horizon of 1.

Model_3_dense_w30_h7
This model uses a dense neural network with a window size of 30 and a horizon of 7.

Model_4_CONV1D
This model uses a 1D convolutional neural network.

Model_5_LSTM
This model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

Model_6_multivariate
This model uses a multivariate neural network with multiple features.

Model_8_NBEATs
This model uses the Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (N-BEATS) architecture.

Model_9_ensemble
This model is an ensemble of the above models.

Model_10_turkey
This model uses the turkey method for detecting outliers and is used as a benchmark.
